Stargate: Tech giants announce AI plan worth up to $500bnBritish Broadcasting CorporationBritish Broadcasting Corporation,"The creator of ChatGPT, OpenAI, is teaming up with another US tech giant, a Japanese investment firm and an Emirati sovereign wealth fund to build $500bn (£405bn) of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in the United States. The new company, called The Stargate Project, was announced at the White House by President Donald Trump who billed it ""the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history"" and said it would help keep ""the future of technology"" in the US. But Elon Musk - both a top adviser to Trump and rival to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman - on Wednesday said the venture does not ""actually have the money"" it has pledged to invest. Investment in AI is currently exploding, driving demand for new data centres while also raising concerns about the huge amounts of water and power the facilities require. The venture is a partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, Japan's Softbank - led by Masayoshi Son - and MGX, a tech investment arm of the United Arab Emirates government. The companies said the new venture, which was in the works before Trump took office, had $100bn in funding available immediately, with the rest to come over four years, creating an estimated 100,000 jobs. Commenting on a post on X where OpenAI detailed the plans, Musk, who owns the platform, wrote ""They don't actually have the money."" ""SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority,"" he added. Musk, however, did not provide any details or substantiation for how he had arrived at the much smaller amount. Altman then replied: ""Wrong, as you surely know."" ""Want to come visit the first site already under way?"" Altman added. ""This is great for the country. I realize what is great for the country isn't always what's optimal for your companies, but in your new role I hope you'll mostly put US first."" Musk is spearheading Trump's government efficiency efforts and will closely advise Trump on spending. He, though, has also been feuding with Altman since leaving OpenAI's board in 2018 and launching his own AI start-up. A source close to Stargate said it was not clear where Musk had gotten his information and that the company was well-positioned to deploy $100 bn. Stargate's first data centre is under construction in Texas, according to Oracle's chief technology officer, Larry Ellison, and more will be built in other US locations. ""I think this will be the most important project of this era,"" said Altman at Trump's Tuesday announcement, standing alongside the President at the White House. ""We wouldn't be able to do this without you, Mr President,"" he added, even though the project was underway before Trump won November's election. The US is already the world leader in AI investment, vastly outspending any other country, and its big tech companies have been making major investments into data centres in the last year. Microsoft, one of the OpenAI's major backers, said earlier this month it was on track to invest $80bn to build out AI-focused data centres this year. It is also involved in a $100bn venture that includes BlackRock and MGX and is focused on making AI data centre investments. Amazon has been pouring money into the centres at a similar scale, announcing two projects worth about $10bn each in just the last two months. In a report last year, McKinsey said that global demand for data centre capacity would more than triple by 2030, growing between 19% and 27% annually by 2030. For developers to meet that demand, the consultancy estimated that at least twice the capacity would have to be built by 2030 as has been constructed since 2000. But analysts have warned that the process is likely to be bogged down by issues such as power and land constraints and permitting. Trump, who has claimed credit for fostering business investment, promised he would intervene to help the industry. ""I'm going to help a lot through emergency declarations because we have an emergency,"" he said, stressing the importance of keeping AI in the US. Trump said his government would ""make it possible for them to get that production done very easily."" OpenAI has long called for more investment into data centres for AI. The Information, a technology news website, first reported on the Stargate project in March last year. Other technology partners include British chipmaker Arm, US chipmaker Nvidia and Microsoft, which already has a partnership with OpenAI. Along with Musk's scepticism about funding for the specific project, there are growing concerns generally about the data centres taxing energy supplies and questions about the role of foreign investors. In one of his final acts in the White House, former President Joe Biden put forward rules that would restrict exports of AI-related chips to dozens of countries around the world, saying the move would help the US control the industry. He also issued orders related to the development of data centres on government land, which spotlighted a role for clean energy in powering the centres. But Trump also raises tariffs on goods from China to at least 125% ""effective immediately"". Trump has said he is authorising a universal ""lowered reciprocal tariff of 10%"" for most countries, except China, while tariff negotiations continue. Tariffs are a key part of the US president's political vision, but economists fear a global trade war. Manufacturers and exporters are scrambling after 104% tariff on China-made goods comes into effect. The cost of borrowing for the US government rose as confidence in the economy waned.

"LA fires: What's happening in Los Angeles, and what caused the wildfires?British Broadcasting CorporationBritish Broadcasting Corporation","At least 25 people have died in the Los Angeles fires as two major blazes continue to burn across the sprawling US city. Firefighters made progress over the weekend in containing the Palisades and Eaton fires but warn that the return of high winds - forecast until Wednesday - could see these two spread again, or fuel new ones. The fires are already among the most destructive in LA's history when measured by the number of buildings destroyed. Rebuilding work will cost ""tens of billions"" of dollars, US President Joe Biden has said. An area to the north-west of the city centre is described by officials as ""particularly dangerous"". A red flag warning - indicating a high level of fire danger - is in place until 18:00 (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday, with the strongest Santa Ana winds expected on Tuesday. Nearby, the largest fire is in the Palisades area, and has burnt through more than 23,000 acres. It is still only about 14% contained, despite the efforts of thousands of firefighters. The blaze is moving east, threatening the exclusive neighbourhood of Brentwood, home to the Getty Center, a world-famous art museum that has evacuated its staff. Another fire, Eaton, is more deadly than Palisades so far - responsible for 16 of the deaths. The overall destruction is immense, with more than 12,000 structures - homes, outbuildings, sheds, mobile homes and cars - destroyed. Celebrities Mel Gibson and Paris Hilton are among those who have lost their homes. Tens of thousands of homes are also without power. The fires could turn out to be the costliest in US history, with damage projected at up to $150bn, according to a preliminary estimate by AccuWeather. There are three active fires in the wider area, while a smaller fire is nearly contained, say California fire officials: The earlier Kenneth, Archer, Sunset, Lidia, Woodley and Olivas fires have been contained. Containment describes the progress firefighters make in controlling the spread of flames. It is often listed as a percentage. For example, if a fire is 14% contained, that means fire crews have established barriers around 14% of the fire's perimeter. Natural barriers include roads, rivers and oceans. Firefighters can also create barriers using equipment such as bulldozers, hoses and shovels to remove vegetation down to the bare soil, meaning there is nothing for the fire to burn. A fire being 100% contained doesn't mean it has been extinguished, but rather that the flames have been fully encircled and the spread has been effectively stopped. Detectives continue to investigate the possible causes. Lightning - the most common source of fires in the US - has been ruled out as a cause for the Palisades and Eaton fires. There has been no official indication so far that arson or utility lines - the next two biggest culprits in sparking fires - caused any of the conflagrations. However, in the case of the Eaton fire, legal cases have been filed against the electrical company, Southern California Edison Company (SCE), claiming there is evidence that the blaze - one of the largest - was ignited due to negligence of the firm's overhead wires. SCE has vowed to ""review the complaint when it is received"", pointing out that ""the cause of the fire continues to be under investigation"". A spokeswoman added that the company ""remains committed"" to supporting communities affected by the fires. On Friday, SCE said authorities were investigating whether its infrastructure was involved in the ignition of the separate Hurst fire. California's very wet years of 2022-23 brought about a huge growth of vegetation, which dried out in the drought of last year, creating abundant kindling. Conditions have been ripe for wildfires thanks to a combination of an exceptionally dry period - downtown LA has only received 0.16 inches (0.4cm) of rain since October - and powerful offshore gusts known as the Santa Ana winds. A political row about the city's preparedness has erupted after it emerged some fire crews' hoses ran dry. California Governor Gavin Newsom has called for an independent investigation into the loss of water pressure to hydrants and why the Santa Ynez Reservoir was closed for maintenance and empty when the fire broke out. ""Losing supplies from fire hydrants likely impaired the effort to protect some homes and evacuation corridors,"" he wrote. LA Mayor Karen Bass, who was on a previously arranged trip to Ghana when the fires began, has faced intense questions about the region's preparedness and the water issues. On Saturday, she deflected questions about her handling of the emergency. Before the fires broke out, the city of LA's fire chief warned in a memo that budget cuts were hampering the department's ability to respond to emergencies. But another official, the LA County fire chief, denied his department had been unprepared. Although strong winds and lack of rain are driving the blazes, experts say climate change is altering the background conditions and increasing the likelihood of such fires. Much of the western United States including California experienced a decades-long drought that ended just two years ago, making the region vulnerable. ""Whiplash"" swings between dry and wet periods in recent years created a massive amount of tinder-dry vegetation that was ready to burn. US government research is unequivocal in linking climate change to larger and more severe wildfires in the western US. ""Climate change, including increased heat, extended drought, and a thirsty atmosphere, has been a key driver in increasing the risk and extent of wildfires in the western United States,"" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says. Fire season in southern California is generally thought to stretch from May to October - but the Governor Newsom has pointed out earlier that blazes are now a perennial issue. ""There's no fire season,"" he said. ""It's fire year."" No one can say when the Los Angeles fires will finally go out. The city is bracing for continued burning and a possible spread amid the latest wind warnings. The Santa Ana winds that fanned the flames are set to strengthen, with strong gusts on Tuesday before the severity is expected to drop. There are now new red flag warnings for dangerous wind storms. The other conditions that fed the fire - dry brush and lack of precipitation - continue as well. Have you been affected by the fires in California? Get in touch here.

"Cameroon’s historic malaria vaccine introduction shows signs of success, one year onverifiedverifiedverifiedverifiedverifiedverifiedverifiedverifiedverifiedverified","A year ago, Cameroon kicked off a wave of ground-breaking malaria vaccination campaigns. With nearly 140,000 kids now vaccinated across the country, authorities are already seeing the impact. Disclaimer If you would like to republish this article, please follow these steps: use the HTML below; do not edit the text; include the author’s byline; credit VaccinesWork as the original source; and include the page view counter script. Eighteen-month-old twins Daniel and Daniella were the first children in Cameroon to receive the world’s first malaria vaccine when the country officially introduced the jab into its vaccination schedule a year ago, on 22 January 2024. The Cameroonian launch marked the first in a history-making series of vaccine campaigns: by year’s end, a total of 17 African nations had kicked off their own malaria immunisation programmes. Helen Akono, mother to the twins, recalls feeling fortunate – her kids had just turned six months old, the eligible age for the first dose of the four-part vaccine series, when the jab became available. Daniel and Daniella have since taken two additional doses of the vaccine, and are poised to take the fourth and last dose when they turn two in June this year. “Since taking the vaccine, my children haven’t suffered from malaria and I believe it could be thanks to it,” Akono tells VaccinesWork over the phone, raising her voice to be heard over her children’s chatter in the background . “My twins are so lucky. Many members of my family, including myself, have suffered from malaria in the past. And treating it usually costs us a fortune,” recalls the mother of five. Malaria remains the leading cause of hospitalisations in Cameroon, one of 17 countries shouldering 70% of the global malaria burden. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that Cameroon saw more than 7.3 million malaria cases in 2023 alone, with 11,600 of those cases ending in death. Meanwhile, approximately 30% of outpatient visits in the country are malaria-related. As in other endemic countries, the disease’s impact is particularly felt among children aged under five, and among pregnant women. The historic roll-out of the world’s first malaria vaccine in Cameroon has been hailed as a major step forward in the battle against one of the world's deadliest diseases. One year on – early days, epidemiologically speaking – medics and beneficiaries have kept an eye out for signs of its impact at health facilities and in households. So have health officials, and the first statistical indicators are promising. Data released this month by Cameroon’s Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) found that the country saw a 13% drop in all-cause consultations for children aged under five. In districts that were included in the first wave of the malaria vaccine roll-out, that drop was higher: 17%. Moreover, nationwide, 13% fewer children aged under five died, from any cause, in 2024 than in 2023. Experts caution that it’s too early to attribute those positive trends to the vaccine with confidence, calling for more in-depth, longer-term research. But, as VaccinesWork found, health workers and parents are independently reporting heartening observations from the ground. Part of the reason the full impact of the malaria vaccine programme won’t be seen for a while is that not all of Cameroon has access to the jab yet. The country aimed to reach half a million children with the malaria vaccine in 2024 and 2025 (approximately 250,000 each year). Only the hardest-hit places – 42 of the country's 206 health districts – were prioritised for involvement in the campaign’s first phase. By December 2024, the first dose had achieved a 63% coverage rate Cameroon-wide. Coverage with the second dose stood at 50%, and coverage with the third dose was at 46%. Dr Tchokfe Shalom Ndoula, Permanent Secretary of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in Cameroon cautions, however, that these figures do not take into account ongoing catch-up sessions. “For now, the roll-out concerned 42 malaria-prone districts,” Dr Ndoula tells VaccinesWork, explaining that the country has plans to reach the rest of the country in due course. Cameroon has so far received 553,100 doses of the RTS,S, malaria vaccine – the bulk of which (539,100) were donated by Gavi. “Our objective has not yet been attained. But the outcome is not negligible because we didn’t imagine attaining that coverage [right away], come to think of the conspiracy theories that accompanied the introduction of the vaccine,” Dr Ndoula says. “All districts in Cameroon are at risk of malaria and, as a result, need this vaccine. The malaria vaccine has already been integrated into Cameroon’s routine immunisation programme, meaning it shall henceforth be administered alongside other vaccines.” At the Soa District Hospital, located on the outskirts of Cameroon’s capital city, Yaoundé, where the malaria vaccination roll-out was officially launched, medics say they have seen fewer paediatric hospitalisation and consultations for malaria in the last year. Before the advent of the vaccine, three in every five patients received in the hospital presented with malaria. Daniele Ekoto, a senior state registered nurse who runs the vaccination service at the hospital, says the introduction of the malaria vaccine has been “a huge success”, with the hospital beating its initial monthly target of vaccinating 28 babies every month. More than 600 children have received the first dose of the vaccine at this health facility as of November 2024, hitting a 77% coverage rate for the entire period – higher than the EPI’s target for 2024, which was set at 69%. Nearly 500 children have received the second dose, giving a 70% coverage rate, while slightly over 500 have received the third dose, giving a 73% coverage rate. “Parents – including those whose children are not eligible – are increasingly showing up to have their children vaccinated,” Ekoto tells VaccinesWork. “We have had numerous testimonies from parents,” Ekoto continues. “A mother testified that her children who took the vaccines have not contracted malaria, whereas those who didn’t [because they were not eligible] have had bouts of malaria. Malaria-related hospitalisations among children have greatly reduced in this hospital since the introduction of the vaccine.” The malaria vaccine is administered in four doses, the first at six months, followed by two more, each at a one-month interval from the last, with the fourth dose administered over a year later. Each dose is delivered as an injection to the thigh, a method aligned with other long-established jabs that are part of Cameroon’s immunisation programme, which has been a stalwart presence in the country’s health system for almost 50 years. The RTS,S vaccine joins the 14 antigens already well-established in Cameroon’s vaccination programme. Elsewhere in Cameroon, too, parents are turning out in rising numbers for the malaria jab. Such is the case in the greater north of the country, which encompasses the Adamawa, the Far North and the North regions, where malaria transmission follows pronounced seasonal patterns. Eighteen-year-old Zenab Tchansia, a housewife living in the Gazawa district in Cameroon’s Far North region, is anxiously looking forward to completing her child's malaria vaccine schedule this February. Ousman Bilal, aged 13 months, has already received three doses of the vaccine. “My child didn’t suffer from any side-effects after taking the vaccine,” Zenab tells VaccinesWork in a telephone chat. “Having suffered from malaria twice in the past, I know what that means, which is why I don't want my child to experience it,” the mother of one said. Zouera Abdou, 26, living in the same district, says her seven-month-old son, Balkissou Ousmailla, has so far received two doses of the malaria vaccine. “The child had a mild fever after taking the first dose of the vaccine in November but felt okay after taking the second dose in December,” recalls Zouera. “My child has been receiving all other vaccines, so why not the malaria vaccine? The vaccine has come at an opportune moment. My child is lucky. Malaria has cost my family a fortune in the past,” she tells VaccinesWork. Nine out of 33 health districts in the Far North region were selected for the first phase of the roll-out. Statistics from the malaria control programme in the region reveal that 70,368 children have so far been vaccinated. This gives a 60% coverage rate for the first dose, 44% for the second dose, and 33% for the third dose. “Conscious of the damage that malaria often causes in households, parents have totally embraced the anti-malaria vaccine,” Dr Kidwang Jean Pierre, who works for the National Malaria Control Programme as the regional malaria coordinator for the Far North region, tells VaccinesWork. Kidwang explains that several traditional and religious leaders have voluntarily opted to get personally involved in the roll-out. “A number of strategies have been put in place in this region to fight malaria, namely the use of mosquito nets, seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), malaria chemoprevention among pregnant women, and now the new malaria vaccine. All of these interventions have had a real impact on malaria morbidity and mortality in the region,” Kidwang says. “We have observed that most of the children who received the vaccine and the SMC did not contract malaria this year. This saved households and families from constant hospital visits.” Studies conducted on the RTS,S antimalarial vaccine pilot programme, which began in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi in 2019, found a 13% reduction in all-cause mortality among eligible vaccinated children. Moreover, the vaccine was found to lead to a 22% reduction in hospitalisations for severe forms of malaria in these children, resulting not only in a significant reduction in suffering for families but also substantial savings for the healthcare system. Dr Ndoula of the EPI had, during the vaccine's introduction, hoped that achieving optimal coverage could potentially slash annual deaths by more than a third, and result in a major decrease – more than 60% – in hospitalisations for severe malaria cases in covered areas. One year into the roll-out, it’s too soon to comprehensively assess the vaccine’s impact, but the health expert rejoices at the “largely positive” feedback from beneficiaries. “These households have confessed to witnessing fewer cases of malaria among children who have received the vaccine,” he says, nonetheless sounding a note of caution. “But we still need time to be able to scientifically determine the impact of the vaccine on (malaria) mortality. It will take many years to do that alongside other malaria preventive measures.” Dr Wirngo Mohamadu Suiru, malaria programme management specialist working with the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) at USAID Cameroon, says the introduction of the malaria vaccine constitutes an “important step” in boosting the fight against malaria in the country. “This is especially important as it reduces the burden of the disease in the most vulnerable/affected age-group (children below five years),” Suiru tells VaccinesWork. “Since its introduction, there has been optimal uptake of the vaccine by the population despite rumours at introduction that were properly handled through a communication strategy developed with support from PMI,” he says. “Cameroon is one of the countries in Africa with the highest burden of malaria and as such, drives the epidemic worldwide. In line with the HBHI (high burden high impact) approach by WHO, adopting new tools is imperative to accelerate progress towards eliminating malaria.” Subscribe to Global Health Notes, our weekly LinkedIn newsletter, to get the latest VaccinesWork news and features.

Analysis: Trump’s second inaugural shows a president in a hurry to wield great power | CNN PoliticsClose icon,"Follow: President Donald Trump used his second inaugural address to hold up his indomitability and escape from a would-be assassin’s bullet as a metaphor for a “strong,” “proud” nation that “will not be conquered.” “I was saved by God to make America Great Again,” Trump said Monday in a follow-up to his “American Carnage” first inaugural in 2017, this one delivered in the US Capitol Rotunda after frigid weather moved the ceremony inside. Related article Fact check: Trump makes false claims about elections, immigration and more in Inauguration Day speeches Trump, in the manner of a classic strongman leader, leveraged his personal mythology after he was sworn in for a new term, inspiring his supporters but leaving those who fear him anxious that dark days may be ahead. On one level, Trump’s speech could be viewed as a new attempt to redefine America’s historic mission, to inject new self-confidence into a citizenry worn down by years of crisis and to position himself as a global peacemaker. “We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent and totally unpredictable,” he said. “America will be respected again and admired again … we will be prosperous. We will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before. We will not be conquered. We will not be intimidated. We will not be broken, and we will not fail.” Trump’s appeal was a powerful call to citizens to “dream boldly” to create a new “golden age of America.” But after promising a “thrilling new era of national success,” the speech didn’t take too long to degenerate into his dystopian worldview — of a nation impoverished, in the grip of raging violent crime and defenseless against an “invasion” of convicts and overseas criminals. And in a later speech to supporters in the Capitol Visitor Center, he cut loose even further, pledging to soon take action to free rioters imprisoned after the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. With the rest of the world watching, Trump included an extraordinary moment in his inaugural address — warning that the spirit of the Panama Canal treaty had been broken and that “we’re taking it back.” His comment didn’t necessarily mean he’s planning an armed invasion to reclaim the critical waterway. But it hinted at a return to an age of American imperialism and a world of great power spheres of influence that has already been fostered by Russia’s and China’s claims on Ukraine and Taiwan, respectively. Trump’s “America First” vision, at home and abroad, is one that millions of Americans share and helped him win last year’s election. Evoking it with the pillars of Washington’s elite political establishment around him — ex-presidents, senators, representatives and in front of the Beltway press — is consistent with Trump’s mission and mandate. He’s an avatar for frontier values and a voice of working Americans who see the VIPs as architects of a system that disdains them, rips them off and sends their children off to fight in unjustified foreign wars. Still, presidents traditionally use inaugural addresses to bind up the lingering wounds of bitter election campaigns and try to get a divided populace pushing, for a few months at least, in roughly the same direction. There wasn’t a lot to distinguish this inaugural from a Trump rally in a minor league sports arena during the campaign. Related card Donald Trump’s second inaugural speech, annotated and fact checked Despite his more soaring passages, Trump didn’t stick long with the poetry of unity. His address seemed more an attempt to assert dominance and to give definition to a second-chance presidency beginning in a blaze of executive power. But perhaps because Trump is so well known, his address didn’t quite stir the kind of shock that he effected eight years ago. And it was a more coherent statement from a president who knows how to wield power and can’t wait to do so again. “In 2017, he just wasn’t really prepared from the get-go to be president. He won kind of unexpectedly. Didn’t win the popular vote. There were all the questions of legitimacy, both externally and even his own party,” said Aaron Kall, director of the University of Michigan’s National Championship-winning debate team. “But clearly he has a better idea of what he wants to do and his governing philosophy and is much confident in his own political instincts.” With Joe Biden sitting behind him, in the first minutes of his post-presidency, Trump launched into a bitter indictment of the last four years. “We have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home, while at the same time stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad. It fails to protect our magnificent law-abiding Americans citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals,” Trump said. He went on: “We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves.” Inaugural addresses featuring a president of a new party always carry implicit criticism of the departing incumbent. But they are rarely so blunt. Still, Trump had political work to do with his speech that heralded his entry into lame duck territory since he is constitutionally barred from running for another term. Despite his vast ambitions, his political viability may not last long unless he can bring down prices for food and lodging that shaped the election. Trump also danced in the end zone, savoring his victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris, who looked on impassively. “It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country,” Trump said, in a typical boast. “Very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states and the popular vote. We won by millions our people.” The new president was watched at close quarters by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, and Mark Zuckerberg, representing internet giants X, Amazon, Google and Meta, who control the sources of information that decide how hundreds of millions will perceive the second Trump presidency. Their rush to embrace Trump reflects a president vindicated by his triumph, with little room in his win-loss worldview to offer olive branches to the vanquished. This is also why his second presidency may be as acrimonious as his first. Related gallery In pictures: The inauguration of Donald Trump In the same ornate space where his rioting supporters roamed on January 6, 2021, the president also portrayed himself as a victim of weaponized justice, in a fresh attempt to remake history over his efforts to steal the 2020 that he lost to Biden. “Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed, to take my life,” he said, referring to failed legal attempts to call him to account for January 6 and the first of two assassination attempts against him. Biden’s presence at the inauguration was the last act of a presidency that he devoted to restoring democratic principles following Trump’s attempt to subvert democracy four years ago. Unlike Trump, he showed up to his successor’s swearing in, despite the deep animosity that simmers between them. But in a stunning development, the outgoing White House announced in the last 20 minutes of his term that he’d offered preemptive pardons to his two brothers and his sister, to shield them from any criminal prosecutions by the incoming Trump administration. On the one hand, this was another example of Biden, who previously pardoned his son Hunter over firearms and tax offenses, subverting judicial norms and damaging the system he promised to protect. But the fact that he contemplated such action at all shows how Trump has already transformed perceptions of presidential conduct. Trump ended his second inaugural address by telling “every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you.” He added: “I will fight for you, and I will win for you.” New Vice President JD Vance had it right when he said the address was “hell of the way to start the next four years.” But there was more. After the inaugural address, Trump went downstairs into the US Capitol Visitor Center to give the speech he really wanted to give. He confided to an overflow crowd that Vance and first lady Melania Trump had convinced him to leave some of his most alienating rhetoric out — including his coming pardons of January 6 prisoners. The screed that followed was packed with Trump’s greatest hits — like his false claims of a stolen 2020 election, attacks on political enemies like Liz Cheney and hard-to-follow rambles through unconnected topics. This second speech showed that in many ways, Trump’s next term will not be much different than the first. But as the inaugural address made clear, Trump knows exactly what he wants to do this time and thinks he has the unfettered power to make it happen. © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

2025 California wildfires - Wikipedia,"There are a series of wildfires burning throughout the state of California. As of April 2025, a total of 610 fires have burned 59,176 acres (23,948 ha) across the state. The timing of ""fire season"" in California is variable, depending on the amount of prior winter and spring precipitation, the frequency and severity of weather such as heat waves and wind events, and moisture content in vegetation. Northern California typically sees wildfire activity between late spring and early fall, peaking in the summer with hotter and drier conditions. Occasional cold frontal passages can bring wind and lightning. The timing of fire season in Southern California is similar, peaking between late spring and fall. The severity and duration of peak activity in either part of the state is modulated in part by weather events: downslope/offshore wind events can lead to critical fire weather, while onshore flow and Pacific weather systems can bring conditions that hamper wildfire growth.[3][4] The 2025 fire season started in early January when a powerful Santa Ana wind event brought extreme winds to much of Southern California,[5] causing multiple fires to spread rapidly throughout the Greater Los Angeles area, destroying thousands of structures and burning over 50,000 acres.[1][6] According to climate scientists, climate change increased the likelihood of the event by creating first a very strong rainfall (which resulted in more vegetation), and then a very strong drought (which dried the vegetation). The likelihood for such events increased by 31–66% from 1950. Previous climate models underestimated the risk, but even they said that a 3-degree temperature rise will double the chances for such events in comparison to current conditions. Climate change also increases the intensity of winds, and reduces the amount of water available for stopping the wildfires.[7][8][9] Scientists from the University of California made a fast evaluation, estimating that the difference between the average temperatures in 1980–2023 and the abnormally hot 2024 alone is responsible for 25% of the moisture deficit which was one of the causes of the wildfires. They mentioned that ""Substantial anthropogenic warming occurred prior to this period, so our estimate of the effect of heat anomalies in 2024 is conservative"". Their study is still not peer reviewed.[10] Another analysis from ClimaMeter estimated that the weather conditions in the region when the wildfires begun were ""up 5°C warmer, 3 mm/day (up to 15%) drier, and up to 5 km/h (up to 20%) windier"" during the years 1987–2023 in comparison to the years 1950–1986. It was mainly due to climate change, while natural variability played only a small role.[11] Additionally, as climate change made the wildfire season in California longer, it further overlapped with the season of Santa Ana winds (October-January).[12] Analysis from Climate Central and World Weather Attribution also found that climate change strongly increased the likelihood of the wildfires not by one, but by multiple ways.[13][14] The wildfires destroyed houses of some of the richest people in California, including many homes in Malibu's Carbon Beach, colloquially also known as ""Billionaire's Beach"".[15] The estimated cost of these wildfires is about 250 to 275 billion US dollars.[16] Organizations within California, like the Michelson Found Animals and Better Neighbor Project have come together to make donations and help families who have been affected by the fires.[17] The following is a list of fires that burned more than 1,000 acres (400 ha), produced significant structural damage, or resulted in casualties.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_California_wildfires,2025-04-09
Trump is targeting the immigrants who will be called on to rebuild LA | CNN BusinessClose icon,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: On the outskirts of Altadena, where one of the most destructive firestorms in Los Angeles history had just receded, a group of volunteers worked last week to gather fallen tree branches and leaves — removing fuel for potential future fires, bagging them up and taking them away. One of those people, Cesar, a Mexican immigrant in his early 60s, works as a day laborer in construction, picking up jobs helping to build and remodel homes around LA. Though Cesar, who asked only to be identified by his first name, told CNN he has worked in California for more than 30 years, he is undocumented. But now, the prospect of mass deportations under President Donald Trump’s second term could lead to the loss of construction workers like Cesar — and stands to seriously hinder efforts to rebuild the more than 12,000 structures estimated to be destroyed by the fires. Homebuilders across LA told CNN they anticipate that rebuilding the city after the destruction caused by the Palisades and Eaton fires will be a slow and challenging process. Key to that endeavor are the mostly undocumented day laborers who often do the physically taxing and dangerous work of clearing the rubble after a natural disaster recedes. Cesar and the rest of his cleanup crew are “second responders,” said Victor Narro, the project director for the UCLA Labor Center. In the shadows, these workers have helped build America’s second-largest city and, after the destruction is cleared, they will help to restore burned homes and businesses, Narro said. “If there are deportations, who is going to do the work of this large immigrant workforce?” Narro said. Building in Los Angeles is already notoriously tough due to a maze of permits and red tape. Waiting on full payouts from insurance companies may hold up the reconstruction process, as well. In addition, LA is one of America’s most expensive housing markets. Now, with thousands of people displaced from their homes, some experts anticipate the city’s housing market will grow even tighter and building costs may rise. “If Trump does crack down on illegal immigration, it would likely affect lower-end homes,” said Dougal Murray, CEO of Racing Green Group, a builder of custom homes in Hollywood and Malibu. “People who have a lower budget will be more likely to work with unlicensed subcontractors or those who employ undocumented immigrants” because of the lower cost to hire them. Bob Kleiman, owner of a homebuilding company in Woodland Hills, just outside LA, said he was hopeful that the Trump administration would come to the realization that mass deportations could hurt a city reeling from two of the most destructive fires in its history. “I’m an optimist that they won’t pull the rug out from underneath an already aggravated situation,” Kleiman said. “I hope they won’t move forward with something that will further add salt to this wound.” But Trump rose to the presidency for the second time on promises to intensify border security and deport record numbers of migrants — and he and his allies have said that undocumented immigrants share the blame for America’s home affordability crisis. Just weeks after Trump was reelected, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously voted to adopt a “sanctuary city” ordinance, barring city employees from aiding Immigration and Customs Enforcement unless required by federal law. But on Monday, Trump began his term by taking a series of sweeping executive actions on immigration, including declaring a national emergency at the US southern border and directing federal officials to take actions “to ensure that so-called sanctuary jurisdictions… do not receive access to Federal funds.” Trump has also signaled he will coordinate immigration sweeps in major cities with ICE. More than one-third of construction workers in the US labor force are foreign-born, according to the US Census Bureau’s 2023 American Community Survey. California is tied with New Jersey as having the highest share of foreign-born workers in the construction trade of any US state, at 52%. While the Census Bureau does not directly ask about immigration status, the National Immigration Forum, an organization that advocates for immigration reform, estimated that undocumented workers make up nearly a quarter of the construction workforce in America. Simply replacing those workers with legal American workers may not be a viable solution. Even with millions of undocumented people estimated to be in the country, there were 276,000 open construction jobs as of November, the latest data available, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s down from more than 400,000 open jobs last year, but still a significant shortfall. Cameron Irwin, the owner of Cambuild Constructions, a homebuilder in the Altadena area, said he has noticed a shortage of skilled construction laborers in Los Angeles. “Building a house is strenuous. It’s hard work that requires a lot of physical labor,” Irwin said. “People are finding that they can do something that’s paying similar, and they don’t have to put that effort in. That’s where the undocumented workers come in.” Irwin’s own home in Altadena was destroyed by the fires earlier this month. Cesar, the man who works as a day laborer in Los Angeles, told CNN he believes mass deportations would hurt more than just individuals like him. “California is the fifth largest economy in the world. Part of that is due to the economic contributions of the immigrant community,” he said in an interview translated from Spanish. “If these deportation threats are carried out, it would have an enormous impact not only on a state level. It would be destructive.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes. All times are ET.

Tim Noel: UnitedHealthcare has a new CEO | CNN BusinessClose icon,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: UnitedHealthcare announced a new CEO on Thursday, filling in the spot after Brian Thompson was shot and killed in midtown Manhattan in a targeted attack. Company veteran Tim Noel is the new UnitedHealthcare CEO, the company said in an emailed statement. Noel has been the head of the company’s Medicare and retirement division, according to the company’s website. He joined UnitedHealthcare in 2007 and previously was involved in financial restructuring at Northwest Airlines during its bankruptcy proceedings. Thompson was appointed chief executive of UnitedHealthcare in 2021 and had been at the company since 2004. Luigi Mangione, 26, faces 11 counts in New York, including one of first-degree murder and two of second-degree murder, along with other weapon and forgery charges in Thompson’s killing, according to an indictment. Mangione pled not guilty to state murder and terror charges. The shooting brought fresh public scrutiny into the practices of insurance companies and the healthcare industry in the United States. After the shooting, many companies took steps to protect their head executives. Some scrubbed their websites of top executives’ photographs and increased armed security details for key leaders. Noel “brings unparalleled experience to this role with a proven track record and strong commitment to improving how health care works for consumers, physicians, employers, governments and our other partners,” a spokesperson said in an email Thursday.

Portuguese politician accused of stealing suitcases at airports | Portugal | The Guardian,"Miguel Arruda charged with theft after allegedly removing baggage from carousel and taking it home, reports say A far-right politician in Portugal has been accused of stealing suitcases at several airports and kicked out of his political party as a result, the party has said. According to several news outlets, police questioned Miguel Arruda on Tuesday at Lisbon airport and charged him with luggage theft after some of the missing suitcases were allegedly found at his home. The 40-year-old denied any wrongdoing, telling the broadcaster TVI on Thursday: “I am being crucified on the public square … but until proven otherwise, I am innocent.” Arruda, who decided to remain in the assembly as an independent, asked for his parliamentary immunity to be lifted. Members from his former party Chega booed Arruda during Friday’s parliamentary session. The assembly president, José Pedro Aguiar-Branco, told Arruda to sit at the back of the chamber, where unaffiliated lawmakers are typically seated. Local media reported that police had camera footage allegedly showing the politician taking his suitcase and a second, smaller one off the baggage carousel and then allegedly putting the second one into his own. Arruda defended himself by saying the video surveillance footage could have been generated by artificial intelligence. Prosecutors “confirm only that steps have been taken as part of an investigation … relating to facts that have nothing to do with his official duties”, a spokesperson for the prosecutor general’s office told Agence France-Presse on Friday. The president of Chega, André Ventura, said on Thursday after a meeting with Arruda: “Faced with these circumstances … I can’t allow him to remain in the parliamentary group.” Some media outlets alleged that Arruda had sold the contents of the suitcases online.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/24/portuguese-politician-miguel-arruda-accused-of-stealing-suitcases-at-airports,2025-04-09
Transcript: Trump steers the world towards a tax warFinancial Times,"Sonja Hutson, Emma Agyemang and Hannah Kuchler PublishedJanuary 24 2025 This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘Trump steers the world towards a tax war’ Sonja Hutson Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Friday, January 24th. And this is your FT News Briefing. [MUSIC PLAYING] Donald Trump’s attempt to end birthright citizenship has been blocked and the US president is considering doubling the tax rate for foreign companies. Plus, Ozempic has been like injectable gold recently. But is its reputation starting to tarnish? I’m Sonja Hutson, and here’s the news you need to start your day. [MUSIC PLAYING] A US federal judge has temporarily halted Donald Trump’s executive order to end citizenship at birth. Earlier this week, the president issued an executive order denying US citizenship to children born in the country to unauthorised immigrants. The judge called the policy blatantly unconstitutional. That’s because the 14th Amendment says all, quote, persons born or naturalised in the US are citizens. This decision is the first legal setback for Trump’s administration, and it comes just three days after he returned to the White House. He’s already signed a wave of executive orders, and that is expected to kick off a slew of legal battles. [MUSIC PLAYING] We’ve been talking a lot about the possibility of Donald Trump starting a trade war, but he’s also on the cusp of starting a tax war. The president has signed an executive order telling his administration to come up with retaliatory measures against countries applying what he calls extraterritorial taxes on US multinationals. Here with me to explain is the FT’s global tax correspondent, Emma Agyemang. Hi, Emma. Emma Agyemang Hi. Sonja Hutson So what exactly has Trump done so far? Emma Agyemang Say, within pretty much the first day, he has withdrawn the US from participating in a global tax deal that’s been negotiated at the OECD for the last four years. And there’s two elements to that deal. So the first pillar is seeking to make the world’s biggest companies, which includes many tech companies, pay more tax in the countries where they do business. And the second pillar is the global minimum tax. And it’s designed to ensure companies pay a 15 per cent effective corporate tax rate globally. So yeah, he’s withdrawn the US’s co-operation on the global tax deal, and he’s threatened other countries with retaliatory measures if they try to enforce that deal. Sonja Hutson Do we have a sense of what these retaliatory measures that Trump is talking about in the executive order could actually end up being? Emma Agyemang Yes, there’s a few options. An executive order, it’s made reference to this obscure 90-year-old provision of the US tax code. And that basically allows the US president to retaliate against foreign countries by doubling taxes, which are deemed to sort of be using discriminatory levies on American companies. Then, of course, there’s just the potential of tariffs. So there are various things that could be done. The executive orders Trump’s cabinet to come back within the next 60 days to discuss basically what the options are for retaliation. Sonja Hutson So then where does this move by Trump leave the OECD pact and the global taxation system as a whole? Emma Agyemang So, you know, some tax experts think that potentially this whole deal is dead in the water because the whole point of, in particular, the global minimum tax issue is that you need an enforcement mechanism. And if countries who have passed this deal, try to enforce it and as a result are slapped with retaliation by the US administration, you know, that potentially is going to make those countries wary of enforcing it or lead to this horrible situation that we’ve been talking about with a tit-for-tat sort of tax war. But then the other people say, well, this is the thing with President Trump and it’s all about ask for a deal. And actually, maybe what’s going to happen is that countries are going to agree some kind of compromise. Somebody I was speaking to said that basically the international tax system is moving from a multilateral domain to a bilateral one. Sonja Hutson What kind of impact do you think Trump’s actions could have on corporate profits and also on public finances? Emma Agyemang It’s interesting because actually, even before this week, people were uncertain about the degree to which the OECD global minimum tax, how much extra tax revenue it would raise. So the OECD has put out estimates that it would lead to an increase in additional tax of $190bn a year. Lots of tax experts I speak to question that and think it would lead to a lot less. But in the worst-case scenario, if President Trump leads to sort of retaliatory doubling of taxes and, you know, businesses, really could be caught in the middle from that with lots of potential negative repercussions in terms of supply chains and growth. So it’s quite a complicated picture. Sonja Hutson Emma Agyemang is the FT’s global tax correspondent. Thanks, Emma. Emma Agyemang Thanks very much. [MUSIC PLAYING] Sonja Hutson Investors have lost their appetite for obesity drugs. When weight-loss medications came on the scene in 2021, they exploded in popularity. Novo Nordisk, which makes Ozempic, became Europe’s most highly valued company. But that sugar rush has worn off, and shares in the pharma giant and others like it are feeling the crash. Here to explain what’s changed is the FT’s Hannah Kuchler. Hi, Hannah. Hannah Kuchler Hello. Sonja Hutson So first off, tell us what happened during this period of optimism for these drugs. Why were investors so excited? Hannah Kuchler There’s never been weight-loss drugs like these. And so people got really excited. They looked around and they said actually, a huge proportion of the population in countries like the US are overweight or obese. They did studies that showed actually it’s not just about weight-loss, but it can help prevent heart attacks and strokes and things that healthcare systems really want to prevent and are really expensive. And so they got really excited about how big this market could be. They put their finger in the air. They said 80bn, 100bn, 140bn. And no one really knew. But everyone felt it was going to be really big. Sonja Hutson But as I mentioned earlier, investors have changed their tune since then. So how big of a dip in share prices have we seen recently? Hannah Kuchler It’s quite the dip. I mean, the most dramatic day was just before Christmas for Novo Nordisk. They put out this trial result that missed expectations and the shares were down 21 per cent in one day, which I think almost all analysts thought was an overreaction, but certainly showed how on edge the market is about these stocks. And then just after Christmas, Eli Lilly said that their sales weren’t going to come in as expected for the fourth quarter and they fell 7 per cent in one day. So any bad news is just making these stocks drop. Sonja Hutson Yeah. Why are investors so on edge about these stocks? Hannah Kuchler Well, I think that maybe . . . a couple of things. First of all, valuations got really high. Obesity was the only kind of healthcare trade that any generalists understood, right? They knew people who were taking Zepbound, Wegovy, Mounjaro, Ozempic. And so they piled in and the valuations, I mean, Eli Lilly is trading on a price/earnings ratio of 55. That’s just like double the rest of the sector. And then there were supply problems and that kind of masks for a while our understanding of how big the market was. But I think now people are thinking in the short- to medium term, maybe it’s not quite as big. No one knows. And can they sustain these valuations? Sonja Hutson So what’s the path forward here for these companies? I mean, how can they get their share prices back on track? Hannah Kuchler Well, some of it is actually out of their control. Healthcare in general has been struggling. And that’s because healthcare is often seen as defensive, right? There’s a recession. You want to be in healthcare because people still buy healthcare. And actually, we’re in the opposite environment at the moment where people want to be in cyclical risk on stocks. It’s called the Trump trade. There are a couple of things they can control. The market really, really hates people missing guidance, and both Novo and Lilly have missed the guidance, both on a trial result and sales. So getting back on top of that and being better at predicting will be really helpful. And then there are some milestones, things that people are looking forward to this year. That could be results coming out of an oral drug, a pill for obesity. And also, there’ll be more details of the trial that Novo did that disappointed and maybe will end up being not quite as disappointing as it seemed in the moment. Sonja Hutson Hannah, how should investors be thinking about the next era in this industry? Hannah Kuchler I think that people should be remembering that it is really new. Like, these drugs didn’t exist, you know, three or four years ago, which in drug development terms is a very short period. And so that’s why we don’t really have a handle on how big the market is. We don’t have a handle on how many payers are going to pay for this in the longer term. So I think it’s not that people who are suffering from obesity are not going to take these drugs, but these kind of really basic calculations where people were just saying, you know, number of people suffering of obesity times price equals size of market were pretty naive.

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau resignsBritish Broadcasting CorporationBritish Broadcasting Corporation,"Under growing pressure from his own party, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced he will step down and end his nine-year stretch as leader. Trudeau said he would stay on in office until his Liberal Party can choose a new leader, and that parliament would be prorogued - or suspended - until 24 March. ""This country deserves a real choice in the next election and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,"" he said during a press conference Monday. Trudeau's personal unpopularity with Canadians had become an increasing drag on his party's fortunes in advance of federal elections later this year. ""Last night, over dinner, I told my kids about the decision that I'm sharing with you today,"" he told the news conference in Ottawa. ""I intend to resign as party leader, as prime minister, after the party selects its next leader through a robust nationwide competitive process,"" he said. The president of the Liberal Party, Sachit Mehra, said a meeting of the party's board of directors would be held this week to begin the process of selecting a new leader. Who might replace Trudeau as Liberal Party leader? Why the Trudeau era has come to an end now What happens next for Canada? In a statement, he added: ""Liberals across the country are immensely grateful to Justin Trudeau for more than a decade of leadership to our Party and the country."" ""As Prime Minister, his vision delivered transformational progress for Canadians,"" he said, citing programmes his government has implemented like the Canada Child Benefit and the establishment of dental care and pharmacare coverage for some medication. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said ""nothing has changed"" following Trudeau's resignation. ""Every Liberal MP and Leadership contender supported EVERYTHING Trudeau did for 9 years, and now they want to trick voters by swapping in another Liberal face to keep ripping off Canadians for another 4 years, just like Justin,"" Poilievre wrote on X. Trudeau, 53, had faced growing calls to quit from inside his Liberal Party, which ramped up in December when deputy prime minister and long-time ally Chrystia Freeland abruptly resigned. In a public resignation letter, Freeland cited US President-elect Donald Trump's threats of tariffs on Canadian goods, and accused Trudeau of not doing enough to address the ""grave challenge"" posed by Trump's proposals. Trump has promised to impose a tax of 25% on imported Canadian goods - which economists have warned would significantly hurt Canada's economy - unless the country takes steps to increase security on its shared border. Trudeau said Monday that he had hoped Freeland would have continued as deputy prime minister, ""but she chose otherwise"". Canada has since announced that it will implement sweeping new security measures along the country's US border in response to the threat. In an online post, Trump claimed that pressure over tariffs led to Trudeau's resignation and repeated his jibe that Canada should become ""the 51st State"". ""If Canada merged with the U.S., there would be no Tariffs, taxes would go way down, and they would be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them,"" he wrote. Since 2019, the Liberal Party has governed as a minority party. Following Freeland's resignation, Trudeau lost the backing of parties that had previously helped keep the Liberals in power - the left-leaning New Democrats, who had a support agreement with the Liberals, and the Quebec nationalist party, Bloc Quebecois. The largest opposition party, the Conservatives, have maintained a significant two-digit lead over the Liberals in polls for months - suggesting that if a general election were held today, the Liberals could be in for a significant defeat. Liberals will now choose a new leader to take the party into the next election, which must be held on or before 20 October. A senior government official told the BBC that the race is an open contest, and that the Prime Minister's Office will fully stay out of the process, leaving it to Liberal Party members to decide their future. Speaking to reporters, the Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-François Blanchet suggested that an early election be called once the Liberals choose their new leader. Trudeau is the son of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who dominated the country's politics in the 1970s and '80s. The younger Trudeau became prime minister after the Liberal Party won a sweeping majority in 2015 amid a promise to usher in a new, progressive era of ""Sunny Ways"". His record includes a commitment to gender equality in his cabinet, which continues to be 50% women; progress on reconciliation with Indigenous people in Canada; bringing in a national carbon tax; implementing a tax-free child benefit for families; and legalising recreational cannabis. Assembly of First Nations National Chief Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak praised Trudeau's track record on indigenous issues following his resignation, saying in a statement that he ""has taken meaningful steps to address issues that matter to First Nations"". ""While much work remains, these actions have laid a foundation for future governments to build upon."" Clouds began to hang over Trudeau's government in recent years, which weathered a series of often self-inflicted scandals, including a controversy over a deal with a Canadian firm facing corruption charges and photos that emerged of the prime minister wearing brownface makeup prior to his time in politics. Vaccine mandates and other restrictions were also met with fierce backlash by some Canadians, leading to the Freedom Convoy truck protests in early 2022. Trudeau eventually used unprecedented emergency powers to remove the protesters. As Canada began to emerge from the pandemic, housing and food prices skyrocketed, and his government pulled back on ambitious immigration targets as public services began to show strain. By late 2024, Trudeau's approval rating was at its lowest - just 22% of Canadians saying they thought he was doing a good job, according to one polling tracker. In Ottawa, a small group of protestors danced outside Parliament Hill in celebration of his resignation. One passer-by, however, said he thinks things were fine under Trudeau's watch. ""I'm a carpenter,"" Hames Gamarra, who is from British Columbia, told the BBC. ""I mind my own business, I get my wages, I pay the bills. It's been OK."" Another Canadian, Marise Cassivi, said it feels like the end of an era. Asked if she feels any hints of sadness, she replied: ""No."" ""It's the right thing."" Tariffs are a key part of the US president's political vision, but economists fear a global trade war. Ottawa says it has started a 25% tax on some vehicle imports from the US, retaliating against American measures. Camilla Hempleman-Adams has apologised for offence caused to the Inuit community on Baffin Island. Besides a 10% rate globally, some countries billed as ""worst offenders"" have higher rates including 104% for China. As anger grows over Trump's tariffs, apps and social media groups are helping people avoid US goods. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Indonesia officially becomes full member of BRICS bloc – DW – 01/07/2025,"The BRICS bloc of developing nations has a tenth full member: Indonesia. The world's fourth-most populous nation officially joined the group on Monday, alongside India, Russia, China and others. Indonesia became the tenth full member of the international BRICS group of developing economies on Monday. The announcement was made by Brazil, a founding member of the bloc and the holder of the rotating presidency for 2025. ""The Brazilian government welcomes Indonesia's entry into the BRICS,"" it said in a statement. ""With the largest population and economy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia shares with other members a commitment to reforming global governance institutions and contributes positively to deepening South-South cooperation."" Indonesia's candidacy was initially endorsed by BRICS leaders in August 2023, according to the Brazilian Foreign Ministry. But the world's fourth-most populous nation opted to postpone its formal accession to the bloc until the formation of its newly-elected government. To mark the event, the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Jakarta issed a statement saying: ""This achievement shows Indonesia's increasingly active role in global issues and commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation to create a global structure that is more inclusive and fair."" The BRICS group is named after its original founder members in 2009: Brazil, Russia, India and China, plus South Africa, which joined a year later. In 2024, the alliance expanded to include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. The bloc was conceived as a counterweight to the Group of Seven (G7) developed economies, made up of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. Prior to Indonesia's accession, the BRICS accounted for 46% of the world's population and 35% of global gross domestic product.

Deadly earthquake hits Tibet’s Shigatse: What we know so far | Earthquakes News | Al JazeeraplayShow navigation menuplaysearchcaret-leftcaret-rightplay videoplay videoplay-arrowaj-logoaj-logoaj-logofacebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss,"Search for survivors has ended after the magnitude 7.1 earthquake in Tibet killed at least 126 and wounded dozens. Earthquake hits Tibet’s Shigatse, tremors also felt in Nepal and India A powerful earthquake has struck a remote region of Tibet, killing at least 126 people and wounding more than 100 others, with tremors felt in Nepal, Bhutan and parts of northern India. Videos aired by China’s state broadcaster CCTV showed houses destroyed with the official Xinhua News Agency saying more than 1,000 houses were damaged. The epicentre of the quake was Shigatse, one of the holiest cities of Tibet. Here is what we know so far: The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, while the China Earthquake Networks Center (CENC) recorded a magnitude of 6.8. The quake, just after 9:05am local time (01:05 GMT), shook the region of western China at a depth of about 10km (6 miles). The epicentre of the quake was the Shigatse high-altitude county of Dingri, located on the Chinese side of Mount Everest and home to about 62,000 people. Tuesday’s quake was the most powerful recorded within a 200km (124-mile) radius in the last five years, the CENC added. Shigatse is the seat of the Panchen Lama, a significant figure in Tibetan Buddhism, whose spiritual authority is second only to the Dalai Lama. Dingri is currently experiencing temperatures of about minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The China Meteorological Administration forecast that the mercury will drop to minus 18 degrees Celsius by Tuesday evening. The remote Shigatse is far from China’s main cities. This, combined with the extreme cold, has hindered rescue efforts, according to Al Jazeera’s Katrina Yu, reporting from Beijing. At least 126 people have been killed and another 188 other people are injured as of 7:00pm (11:00 GMT) on Tuesday, according to Xinhua. A man in Kathmandu was injured after jumping off the top of a house following strong tremors, Nepal Police spokesman Bishwa Adhikari told Reuters. No other casualties or damages have been reported so far from Nepal, India and Bhutan. The earthquake caused infrastructural damage, with images showing collapsed homes and other buildings reduced to rubble. The Xinhua news agency reported that more than 1,000 houses have been damaged to varying degrees. “Dingri county and its surrounding areas experienced very strong tremors, and many buildings near the epicentre have collapsed,” according to the state broadcaster CCTV. In the town of Lhatse, videos geolocated by AFP showed debris scattered in front of streetside eateries. Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital, was rattled by the tremor and aftershocks, forcing some residents to rush from their homes. Kathmandu is about 230km (140 miles) south of Shigatse. Tremors were also felt in India’s northern state of Bihar which borders Nepal. They were also felt in Bhutan’s capital Thimphu. According to Nepal’s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA), shocks were experienced in seven hill districts which border Tibet. The search for survivors of Tuesday’s magnitude 7.1 earthquake has ended. Rescue and recovery personnel are now turning their attention to helping the 46,000 people displaced by the quake. The Chinese government had initially deployed some 1,500 rescue workers, including military personnel, to the area. Al Jazeera’s Yu on Tuesday said that there were pictures of those affected by the earthquake being treated on the streets. Xinhua reported that some 22,000 items of disaster relief aid have been dispatched to the affected areas, which include cotton tents, quilts and items for high-altitude areas. Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasised “the all-out search and rescue efforts, minimising casualties to the greatest extent possible, properly resettling affected residents, and ensuring their safety and warmth through the winter”, CCTV added. Xinhua said that “local authorities are reaching out to various townships in the county to assess the impact of the quake”. The Tibetan Plateau is prone to earthquakes because of colliding tectonic plates. Tibet and Nepal lie on a major geological fault line where the Indian tectonic plate pushes up into the Eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas, and earthquakes are a regular occurrence. The region is seismically active, causing tectonic uplifts that can grow strong enough to change the heights of the Himalayas’ peaks. “Education about earthquakes and earthquake-resilient buildings combined with funding for retrofits and resilient structures can help protect people and buildings when strong earthquakes occur,” Marianne Karplus, a seismologist and geophysicist, told Al Jazeera. “The earth system is very complex, and we cannot predict earthquakes. However, we can conduct scientific studies to better understand what causes earthquakes in Tibet and to better understand the shaking and impacts resulting from earthquakes,” Karplus, who is a professor of geological sciences at the University of Texas at El Paso, said. There have been 29 earthquakes of magnitude three or above in the past five years within 200km (124 miles) of the Shigatse quake epicentre, according to CCTV. However, authorities say that Tuesday’s quake has been “more powerful” than the other earthquakes in the past five years, Al Jazeera’s Yu reported. In 2015, nearly 9,000 people died and more than 22,000 were injured when a magnitude 7.8 quake struck Nepal, destroying more than half a million homes. On May 21, 2021, an earthquake of magnitude 7.3 rattled China’s southern Qinghai province. Tuesday’s quake is among the worst earthquakes to hit the Himalayan region in 100 years.

OpenAI announces new o3 models | TechCrunchOpenAI announces new o3 models | TechCrunch,"Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us OpenAI saved its biggest announcement for the last day of its 12-day “shipmas” event. On Friday, the company unveiled o3, the successor to the o1 “reasoning” model it released earlier in the year. o3 is a model family, to be more precise — as was the case with o1. There’s o3 and o3-mini, a smaller, distilled model fine-tuned for particular tasks. OpenAI makes the remarkable claim that o3, at least in certain conditions, approaches AGI — with significant caveats. More on that below. o3, our latest reasoning model, is a breakthrough, with a step function improvement on our hardest benchmarks. we are starting safety testing & red teaming now. https://t.co/4XlK1iHxFK — Greg Brockman (@gdb) December 20, 2024 Why call the new model o3, not o2? Well, trademarks may be to blame. According to The Information, OpenAI skipped o2 to avoid a potential conflict with British telecom provider O2. CEO Sam Altman somewhat confirmed this during a livestream this morning. Strange world we live in, isn’t it? Neither o3 nor o3-mini are widely available yet, but safety researchers can sign up for a preview for o3-mini starting today. An o3 preview will arrive sometime after; OpenAI didn’t specify when. Altman said that the plan is to launch o3-mini toward the end of January and follow with o3. That conflicts a bit with his recent statements. In an interview this week, Altman said that, before OpenAI releases new reasoning models, he’d prefer a federal testing framework to guide monitoring and mitigating the risks of such models. And there are risks. AI safety testers have found that o1’s reasoning abilities make it try to deceive human users at a higher rate than conventional, “non-reasoning” models — or, for that matter, leading AI models from Meta, Anthropic, and Google. It’s possible that o3 attempts to deceive at an even higher rate than its predecessor; we’ll find out once OpenAI’s red-team partners release their testing results. For what it’s worth, OpenAI says that it’s using a new technique, “deliberative alignment,” to align models like o3 with its safety principles. (o1 was aligned the same way.) The company has detailed its work in a new study. Unlike most AI, reasoning models such as o3 effectively fact-check themselves, which helps them to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. This fact-checking process incurs some latency. o3, like o1 before it, takes a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside? It tends to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and mathematics. o3 was trained via reinforcement learning to “think” before responding via what OpenAI describes as a “private chain of thought.” The model can reason through a task and plan ahead, performing a series of actions over an extended period that help it figure out a solution. We announced @OpenAI o1 just 3 months ago. Today, we announced o3. We have every reason to believe this trajectory will continue. pic.twitter.com/Ia0b63RXIk — Noam Brown (@polynoamial) December 20, 2024 In practice, given a prompt, o3 pauses before responding, considering a number of related prompts and “explaining” its reasoning along the way. After a while, the model summarizes what it considers to be the most accurate response. o1 was the first large reasoning model — as we outlined in the original “Learning to Reason” blog, it’s “just” an LLM trained with RL. o3 is powered by further scaling up RL beyond o1, and the strength of the resulting model the resulting model is very, very impressive. (2/n) New with o3 versus o1 is the ability to “adjust” the reasoning time. The models can be set to low, medium, or high compute (i.e. thinking time). The higher the compute, the better o3 performs on a task. No matter how much compute they have at their disposals, reasoning models such as o3 aren’t flawless, however. While the reasoning component can reduce hallucinations and errors, it doesn’t eliminate them. o1 trips up on games of tic-tac-toe, for instance. One big question leading up to today was whether OpenAI might claim that its newest models are approaching AGI. AGI, short for “artificial general intelligence,” broadly refers to AI that can perform any task a human can. OpenAI has its own definition: “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.” Achieving AGI would be a bold declaration. And it carries contractual weight for OpenAI, as well. According to the terms of its deal with close partner and investor Microsoft, once OpenAI reaches AGI, it’s no longer obligated to give Microsoft access to its most advanced technologies (those that meet OpenAI’s AGI definition, that is). Going by one benchmark, OpenAI is slowly inching closer to AGI. On ARC-AGI, a test designed to evaluate whether an AI system can efficiently acquire new skills outside the data it was trained on, o3 achieved an 87.5% score on the high compute setting. At its worst (on the low compute setting), the model tripled the performance of o1. Granted, the high compute setting was exceedingly expensive — in the order of thousands of dollars per challenge, according to ARC-AGI co-creator François Chollet. Today OpenAI announced o3, its next-gen reasoning model. We’ve worked with OpenAI to test it on ARC-AGI, and we believe it represents a significant breakthrough in getting AI to adapt to novel tasks. It scores 75.7% on the semi-private eval in low-compute mode (for $20 per task… pic.twitter.com/ESQ9CNVCEA — François Chollet (@fchollet) December 20, 2024 Chollet also pointed out that o3 fails on “very easy tasks” in ARC-AGI, indicating — in his opinion — that the model exhibits “fundamental differences” from human intelligence. He has previously noted the evaluation’s limitations, and cautioned against using it as a measure of AI superintelligence. “[E]arly data points suggest that the upcoming [successor to the ARC-AGI] benchmark will still pose a significant challenge to o3, potentially reducing its score to under 30% even at high compute (while a smart human would still be able to score over 95% with no training),” Chollet continued in a statement. “You’ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible.” Incidentally, OpenAI says that it’ll partner with the foundation behind ARC-AGI to help it build the next generation of its AI benchmark, ARC-AGI 2. On other tests, o3 blows away the competition. The model outperforms o1 by 22.8 percentage points on SWE-Bench Verified, a benchmark focused on programming tasks, and achieves a Codeforces rating — another measure of coding skills — of 2727. (A rating of 2400 places an engineer at the 99.2nd percentile.) o3 scores 96.7% on the 2024 American Invitational Mathematics Exam, missing just one question, and achieves 87.7% on GPQA Diamond, a set of graduate-level biology, physics, and chemistry questions. Finally, o3 sets a new record on EpochAI’s Frontier Math benchmark, solving 25.2% of problems; no other model exceeds 2%. We trained o3-mini: both more capable than o1-mini, and around 4x faster end-to-end when accounting for reasoning tokens with @ren_hongyu @shengjia_zhao & others pic.twitter.com/3Cujxy6yCU — Kevin Lu (@_kevinlu) December 20, 2024 These claims have to be taken with a grain of salt, of course. They’re from OpenAI’s internal evaluations. We’ll need to wait to see how the model holds up to benchmarking from outside customers and organizations in the future. In the wake of the release of OpenAI’s first series of reasoning models, there’s been an explosion of reasoning models from rival AI companies — including Google. In early November, DeepSeek, an AI research firm funded by quant traders, launched a preview of its first reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1. That same month, Alibaba’s Qwen team unveiled what it claimed was the first “open” challenger to o1 (in the sense that it could be downloaded, fine-tuned, and run locally). What opened the reasoning model floodgates? Well, for one, the search for novel approaches to refine generative AI. As TechCrunch recently reported, “brute force” techniques to scale up models are no longer yielding the improvements they once did. Not everyone’s convinced that reasoning models are the best path forward. They tend to be expensive, for one, thanks to the large amount of computing power required to run them. And while they’ve performed well on benchmarks so far, it’s not clear whether reasoning models can maintain this rate of progress. Interestingly, the release of o3 comes as one of OpenAI’s most accomplished scientists departs. Alec Radford, the lead author of the academic paper that kicked off OpenAI’s “GPT series” of generative AI models (that is, GPT-3, GPT-4, and so on), announced this week that he’s leaving to pursue independent research.

CrowdStrike outage: What we know 4 days after a software update brought down computer systems around the world | CNNClose icon,"Follow: Hundreds of US flights were canceled Monday as carriers, particularly Delta Air Lines, work to recover four days after a global tech outage caused massive delays and left travelers stranded at airports around the nation. Delta is facing mounting pressure to get passengers back in the air, as it continues to rack up the majority of canceled US flights. US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has expressed frustration with the pace of Delta’s recovery and its CEO has apologized to affected travelers. Over 1,000 flights into, within or out of the United States were canceled Monday, and over 9,000 were delayed, according to flight tracking site FlightAware. Delta passengers have been slammed by more than 4,400 cancellations since Friday, including more than 950 as of Monday evening, by far the most of any airline. Delta declined to comment on the numbers, but in an update to customers Sunday afternoon, CEO Ed Bas tian said the company is working to restore operations for its customers. On Monday, Bastian told employees by video message: “We’ve got everyone around this company working around the clock to get this operation where it needs to be,” according to a news release. The airline – headquartered in Atlanta – said it hopes to “make it right,” offering SkyMiles, vouchers and the right to request a refund, among other offers. Three of those customers, Nicole DaSilva, Tiffany Denlinger and Melissa Levine were stranded at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on Monday, surrounded by bags and lines of weary travelers – with no clear way to get home. Fresh off their vacation in Athens, Greece, the trio has been trying to get back to Arizona for two days. So far, all they have is a stack of canceled flight tickets. Denlinger has an electronic tracker in her luggage and said it’s bounced from concourse to concourse at the Atlanta airport. But because she can’t access her suitcase, she hasn’t been able to use her laptop – leading to lost commissions and income. While Delta says it plans to cover hotel, meal or ground transportation for affected customers, the airline’s policy says it does not compensate passengers for lost income due to canceled flights. DaSilva and Levine managed to find extended care for their dog back in Tucson only to have the air conditioning go out. Tucson is expected to hit a high of 104 degrees Monday. Now the couple is scrambling to find care for their dog somewhere out of the extreme heat. Related article What to do if your flight is canceled or delayed Denlinger said she believes the airline was not prepared for this situation “and we’re just kind of the guinea pigs to something truly catastrophic.” Many stranded passengers are feeling the strain from days without access to their usual resources. Melissa Vestal, a North Carolina resident, told CNN affiliate WCCO on Monday she was running out of her prescription medicines after being stuck at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport for the past three days. “I prepared for an extra day with my medications but then I quickly saw that there’s a possibility that I was going to be here a few days, so I’ve been rationing out my medicines,” Vestal said. “Actually, I don’t have any for today, so I’m hoping that we can find some luck today.” Vestal told WCCO she was flying home on Delta after a trip to Alaska when the outage hit, and she was running on little sleep after waiting for hours in lines for flights over the weekend. Regardless, Vestal praised Delta’s employees, calling them “angels,” and said she had a flight home booked for later Monday. The “largest IT outage in history” – prompted by a software update for Microsoft devices late Thursday into the early hours of Friday – impacted an estimated 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide, causing disorder at airports, outages for 911 services and challenges at health care facilities. While the CrowdStrike problem affected computers meant to check customers in for many airlines, it also disrupted Delta’s crucial crew scheduling software. “In particular one of our crew tracking-related tools was affected and unable to effectively process the unprecedented number of changes triggered by the system shutdown,” Bastian said in the statement. It didn’t help that the outage took place on what Bastian described as “the busiest travel weekend of the summer,” with 90% of the airline’s flights booked. Here’s what we know about the outage and its continued effects. Related article What is CrowdStrike, the company linked to the global outage? The company said the outage was not caused by a security incident or a cyberattack, but rather a software defect. The issue was identified and isolated, and engineers deployed an update to fix the problem, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said. Kurtz has apologized to customers and said the company is “deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption.” In an update posted to LinkedIn late Sunday, CrowdStrike said “a significant number” of the 8.5 million devices were back online and operational. Overall costs from the outage could top $1 billion, Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, told CNN. On Sunday, more than 1,800 US flights were canceled and more than 9,900 delayed, according to FlightAware. Major hotels, including Marriott International and some Hiltons, were impacted both in regard to payment processing and delays to check in-processes. US-based carriers American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Allegiant Air, Sun Country and Frontier Airlines all reported issues on Friday. Delta paused all its flights Friday morning while its systems were offline, and more than 3,500 Delta and Delta Connection flights were canceled through Saturday, according to the airline. More than 1,200 Delta flights were canceled on Sunday, after the carrier canceled 1,208 flights on Saturday, according to FlightAware. Delta said it would not be allowing unaccompanied minors to travel until July 24, due to the outage. Experts are urging travelers who have been forced to cancel trips to look into refund options. New federal rules say travelers deserve cash refunds when inconvenienced by their airline – not vouchers or travel credits. Buttigieg spoke with Delta’s Bastian on Sunday afternoon as the air carrier continues to struggle with a high number of flight cancellations, according to the department. “I have made clear to Delta that we expect the airline to provide prompt refunds to consumers who choose not to be rebooked, and free rebooking and timely reimbursements for food and overnight hotel stays to consumers affected by the delays and cancellations, as well as adequate customer service assistance to all of their passengers,” Buttigieg said in a statement. Other airlines largely got back on track over the weekend, including one of the world’s largest operators, Turkish Airlines, which said Saturday, “The global technical issue has been resolved. All our operations have returned to normal.” The same day, Jetstar Japan, Hong Kong Express and Cebu Pacific airlines said their operations are gradually being restored after disruptions due to the global tech outage. Related article Global tech outage: What to know if you’re traveling this weekend Even with the flawed computer update rolled back, it’s not a quick fix for airlines, which have computers at thousands of gates that will need to be individually rebooted, David Kennedy, cofounder of cybersecurity company Binary Defense, told CNN on Saturday. “It’s not just as simple as rebooting. There’s a lot more steps and complexities in this that are involved,” Kennedy said. “There’s just not enough people at those airports, at those locations to go and do it.” The Monday statement from Delta notes one of its most critical systems, “which ensures all flights have a full crew in the right place at the right time … is deeply complex and is requiring the most time and manual support to synchronize.” Amid the travel chaos, Buttigieg said earlier in a social media post Saturday he received reports of some airlines only offering flight credits to passengers for canceled flights. “Let me be clear – you are entitled to get your money back promptly if your flight is canceled and you don’t take a rebooking,” Buttigieg said. The widespread usage of CrowdStrike’s software meant the outage penetrated numerous industries, including emergency communications, government services and health care. Related article More than 1,500 US flights canceled for the third day straight as airlines slowly recover from global tech outage Large hospital systems, including Mass General Brigham in Massachusetts, Penn Medicine in Pennsylvania, Mount Sinai Health System in New York all reported Friday they were affected by the outage. Emory Healthcare in Atlanta said it had delayed “procedures at ambulatory surgical centers and hospitals are delayed until our systems are stabilized.” Some cancer centers, including Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, also paused certain procedures and scheduled appointments. Several blood banks likewise experienced disruptions. And in a few areas, including Arizona and Alaska, 911 services were briefly disrupted before being restored. Government agencies, including Social Security offices and local Department of Motor Vehicles offices, also temporarily paused their operations due to the outage. Public transportation in Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania were affected but restored operations Friday.

Astronomers discover repeating radio bursts from distant 'dead' galaxy - ABC News,"Researchers say they are puzzled over the discovery. Astronomers have detected fast-repeating radio bursts from a distant ""dead"" galaxy that should not contain the energy to produce these types of signals, according to new research. The source of the fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- sudden flashes of radio waves that last just milliseconds -- has previously been linked to young, magnetized neutron stars that expend a lot of energy when they are forming. But the dormant galaxy from which these radio bursts are originating should not contain this type of young star, according to a paper published Wednesday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Researchers expect FRBs to originate inside of a galaxy and, because these FRBs are so energetic, within a region of a galaxy in which new stars are actively forming, Vishwangi Shah, a PhD student in the Department of Physics and the Trottier Space Institute at McGill University, told ABC News. These FRBs, named FRB 20240209A, are located outside of the massive ancient elliptical galaxy it is associated with that only contains old and dead stars, Shah said. ""This discovery was really surprising and exciting,"" she said. Shah and her team used the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment -- also known as the CHIME telescope -- to detect the multiple bursts from the same location, Shah said. But because the CHIME telescope could not pinpoint the exact location of the radio waves, they combined it with a smaller CHIME-like telescope to pinpoint the location of the FRB. They then used the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii to image the region around the location of the FRBs. The Gemini image confirmed that there is no other galaxy present near the FRB and the FRB is indeed associated with the dead galaxy. ""There's no other galaxy there,"" Shah said. The ancient elliptical galaxy where astronomers discovered the radio waves is about 2 billion light-years from Earth and is about 11.3 billion years old, according to the paper. Thousands of radio bursts have been recorded since 2007, when they were first discovered by astronomers, Shah said, adding that they only know the precise locations of about 100 of them -- almost all near actively forming stars. ""This particular FRB is really an outlier, and it challenges our theories about what is producing FRBs,"" Shah said. Astronomers hypothesize that the FRBs could be originating from two supernova remnants, called neutron stars, that are merging or collapsing onto themselves, Shah said. Continuing to study these FRBs will allow researchers to further understand the space between its origination and the Milky Way as well as what is happening in distant regions of space, Shah said. ""That is why it is a really useful probe of our universe,"" she said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",https://abcnews.go.com/International/astronomers-discover-repeating-radio-bursts-distant-dead-galaxy/story?id=118023080,2025-04-09
What to make of Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship - ABC News,"The policy faces a tough legal battle, but could have a major impact if enacted. For more than a century, being ""born in the USA"" has also meant the certainty of citizenship. But on Monday, President Donald Trump challenged the 14th Amendment's longstanding guarantee of birthright citizenship by issuing an executive order to end the granting of citizenship to children born in the United States to parents who do not have permanent legal status — either by lacking citizenship or having only temporary legal status — at the time of the child's birth. The legality of Trump's action is highly disputed — it's already subject to multiple legal challenges, and a federal court temporarily blocked its implementation on Thursday. It also represents a seismic break with a longstanding status quo, and would remove the United States from the 30-plus countries that grant citizenship to just about any person born within their national borders. Should it hold up in court, Trump's decree could alter the citizenship status of hundreds of thousands of people born in the near future — and have further-reaching effects beyond that. In light of this, I put together a hitchhiker's guide to birthright citizenship in the United States, examining how the policy came to be, how it compares to policies in the rest of the world and the nuances of public opinion on the issue — most surveys show that Trump's decision to end birthright citizenship is unpopular or, at most, highly divisive among Americans. I also dug into what the legal battle over Trump's order looks like, and how its implementation could have huge consequences for not just immigrants but Americans more broadly — including as part of a larger Republican effort to require proof of citizenship for voting and even apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Citizenship around the world rests largely on two concepts, either alone or in combination: jus soli, or ""right of soil,"" based on one's birth in a given place, and jus sanguinis, ""right of blood,"" based on one's familial descent. The United States has long used both: Most anyone born in the United States (besides the children of foreign diplomats) becomes a citizen, while anyone born to American parents, even while abroad, is also guaranteed citizenship. Birthright citizenship as we know it took effect following the Civil War. Passed by Congress in 1866 and ratified by the states in 1868, the 14th Amendment of the Constitution opens by saying that ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" This amendment was, in part, the culmination of a long-running campaign by Black Americans to guarantee their rights against racist laws and the Supreme Court's infamous decision in the 1857 case Dred Scott v. Sandford, which included a ruling that those of African descent could never be U.S. citizens. In 1898, the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Wong Kim Ark buttressed the right to birthright citizenship for individuals born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents: The court determined that the 14th Amendment automatically made Wong Kim Ark a citizen because he'd been born in the United States, even though his parents were Chinese immigrants ineligible to become naturalized citizens under the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. Today, federal law includes birthright citizenship provisions, although Trump's latest salvo is far from the first attempt to undo them. Now, despite Trump's oft-made claim to the contrary, the United States is far from alone in offering birthright citizenship. As of 2022, 60 countries had a provision in their legal codes or constitutions that provide at least some pathway to citizenship by jus soli, according to data from the Global Citizenship Observatory.* And more than half of those nations have a mostly unrestricted version akin to the United States' longstanding formulation, whereby nearly anyone born in that country is guaranteed access to citizenship. (Others may provide for birthright citizenship subject to additional requirements, such as parental descent, period of residence and/or membership of a certain racial or ethnic group.) Overall, unfettered birthright citizenship is mainly found among countries in the Americas, many of which — including the U.S. — have lengthy histories of immigration from other parts of the globe. That's not a coincidence: These nations often permitted ample immigration, and birthright citizenship made it easier for a country to legally incorporate the children of immigrants. By contrast, no European nations and few on other continents have unrestricted birthright citizenship. Over the past few decades, there has been movement toward a more restrictive approach in some developed countries. In the 1980s, both the United Kingdom and Australia restricted birthright citizenship, and in 2005, New Zealand's parliament passed a law to remove automatic birthright citizenship altogether. Still, others have opened the doors to birthright citizenship, such as Germany, which in 2000 added a restricted form to what had previously been a descent-based system. Whether the United States will join the countries that have narrowed their rules regarding birthright citizenship likely hinges on judicial interpretation of which persons are, in the words of the 14th Amendment, ""subject to the jurisdiction"" of the United States. For more than 120 years, the federal government and the courts have taken this to mean that anyone in the country is subject to federal and state laws and that, resultingly, those born here are guaranteed citizenship (indigenous Americans stood as a rare exception until the 1924 Indian Citizenship Act). But ahead of taking office, Trump argued that the amendment's language should apply only to U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, allowing his administration to implement a restrictive form of birthright citizenship. Could Trump's argument carry the day in court? Many legal scholars have expressed doubt that an executive order can override the 14th Amendment. The federal judge who temporarily halted the decree's implementation — a Ronald Reagan appointee — previewed what may be the most likely judicial response, calling it ""blatantly unconstitutional."" Having operated as a precedent for more than a century — reaffirmed in part by a 1982 case — this is far more entrenched legal terrain than some recent precedents the conservative-controlled Supreme Court has overturned, such as abortion (Roe v. Wade, 1973) or the power of federal agencies to interpret ambiguous statutes (Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 1984). Perhaps tellingly, when Trump considered a similar decree during his first term in 2018, then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Republican, said such a move would be insufficient to overcome a plain reading of the Constitution. Still, it's not impossible that the Supreme Court could ultimately agree with Trump, at least in part. Of the court's six conservative justices, Trump placed three on the high court's bench, while the opinions of longer-tenured Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito have often ended up to the right of the Trump-appointed trio. Beyond Trump's alternate interpretation of the 14th Amendment, another argument has also gained traction on the right, particularly after it was embraced by federal Circuit Court Judge James Ho: the idea that birthright citizenship doesn't apply in cases of ""war or invasion,"" and that unauthorized border entries presently constitute such an invasion. Ho, an ultra-conservative Trump appointee, may have been looking to raise his stock as a future Trump pick for the Supreme Court, as he'd previously argued in 2006 that the 14th Amendment did grant automatic birthright citizenship and that a constitutional amendment would be necessary to change this. Trump won the presidency thanks in part to voters' affinity to Trump's more restrictionist views on immigration, which loomed pretty consistently as the second-most salient issue in the 2024 election after the economy. Polls have shown that Americans tend to support Trump's aim to deport many undocumented immigrants and limit their entry into the United States. But even amid a more anti-immigration political atmosphere, surveys still suggest that the public is quite divided over ending birthright citizenship, with support depending in part on how pollsters ask about it. Recent national polls that have asked whether the U.S. should continue to offer birthright citizenship have usually found that a large majority prefer the status quo. But when asked whether they would support ending the policy, particularly for children of undocumented immigrants, opinions are more mixed. Over the past year, six surveys have asked respondents whether they would support ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, with somewhat mixed results. Late in 2024, two polls from YouGov/The Economist found that a narrow plurality of Americans supported this change. But more recently, two surveys from YouGov (one with The Economist), as well as surveys from Ipsos/New York Times and Fabrizio, Lee & Associates/GBAO for The Wall Street Journal, each found more Americans opposed than in favor of ending birthright citizenship. Notably, the Ipsos poll's wording first noted that the 14th Amendment currently guarantees citizenship for those born in the United States, which may have cued some respondents to be less supportive of the change, while The Wall Street Journal poll's question wording didn't mention legal status, and found even less support. At the same time, two surveys conducted last year found at least 60 percent favored continuing birthright citizenship, regardless of whether a child was born to undocumented parents, again demonstrating how the framing of a polling question — in this case, orienting it toward ending a policy or continuing it — can influence the choices that some respondents make. Each of these questions also tended to also use more neutral language, such as ""non-citizen"" or ""regardless of legal status,"" compared with ""illegal"" or ""undocumented"" in most of the surveys about ending it. Regardless of question wording, predictable partisan divisions pop up across most polls. For example, the four YouGov surveys that asked about ending birthright citizenship found that around two-thirds of Republicans supported such a change, while roughly one-fourth of Democrats held a similar view. And the December Quinnipiac University survey that asked about continuing the policy found that about 9 in 10 Democrats wanted to keep granting birthright citizenship, compared with around 4 in 10 Republicans. Of course, this issue is likely still new to many Americans, and we can expect it to rise in salience in light of Trump's executive order. And as is always the case, public opinion can shift once a hypothetical policy that pollsters ask about becomes real. A January AP-NORC survey that asked about this subject a third way — ""changing the Constitution"" — points to how this could matter: While a slight majority opposed doing so, 20 percent of Americans said they neither favored nor opposed such a change. One additional survey by SoCal Strategies for OnPointPolitics asked about birthright citizenship without any reference to existing law and similarly found that 50 percent agreed with giving it to the children of undocumented immigrants, while 33 percent disagreed. Given the current political environment, the legal and political battles to come may polarize public opinion further along party lines, driving even more Republicans firmly into Trump's camp and more Democrats into opposition toward ending birthright citizenship. Should Trump's executive order withstand judicial scrutiny in the long run, its most immediate and direct impact would be on the few hundred thousand newly born people in the United States who would no longer automatically receive citizenship. In 2018, the Pew Research Center estimated around 250,000 births to undocumented immigrants as of 2016 (down from 390,000 in 2007). With uncertainty about where that figure is today, and combined with some tens of thousands of births to individuals with temporary legal status, the total affected by Trump's order may add up to something in the vicinity of 300,000 people, give or take many thousands. That would amount to roughly 8 percent of all births annually (3.6 million births were registered in the United States in 2023). Paradoxically, this could produce a larger population of undocumented immigrants in the medium term. Of course, Trump's immigration policies aim to significantly cut down on the population of undocumented immigrants in the country — which estimates from the Pew Research Center placed at about 11 million in 2022, and may be above 13 million now. But it's unclear if those policies would outbalance the addition of at least one or two hundred thousand noncitizen newborns annually: Since 1990, the annual net change in undocumented immigrants in the country has ranged as high as about +1 million, but has never fallen below around -400,000, according to data from the Center for Migration Studies. Beyond these immediate effects, the restriction of birthright citizenship could also have broader implications for proof of citizenship requirements in the country. After all, if federal agencies have to check the documents of those suspected of not having permanent legal status, it follows that they would have to start checking most everyone's documents. This ties into a larger ongoing push by Republicans to restrict access to certain benefits and political rights, like the ability to vote, based on proof of citizenship. Spurred in large part by Trump's unfounded claims that electoral fraud has been rampant, House Republicans have introduced federal legislation to require all voters to provide documentation, and eight states passed GOP-backed constitutional amendments in 2024 to explicitly outlaw noncitizens from voting, even though that is already illegal in federal elections (and also very rare). The thing is, many citizens who would otherwise be eligible to vote could also get caught in the proof-of-citizenship net. A 2023 survey by the Brennan Center for Justice and the University of Maryland's Center for Civic Democracy and Engagement found that roughly 1 in 10 American citizens of voting age do not have proof of citizenship readily available — that is, a passport, birth certificate or naturalization papers. And the reasons for this aren't nefarious: People may have lost their documents, had them stolen or destroyed, or left them with another family member who lives far away. Trump's actions also point to future attempts to connect citizenship to political representation. Beyond birthright citizenship, the 14th Amendment includes language saying that apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives should occur based on a count of the ""whole number of persons in each state."" Yet during his first term, Trump tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census with an eye on apportioning by only the citizen population. Back then, the Supreme Court shot down Trump's efforts, although its decision suggested the conservative justices might be receptive to different arguments. On Monday, Trump seemingly set the stage to try again ahead of the 2030 census, as he revoked an executive order issued by now-former President Joe Biden that reaffirmed the Census Bureau's practice of including all persons the census counts. Unsurprisingly, the effects of such a change would likely benefit Republicans. Had the 2020 apportionment occurred based on the citizen population, census estimates suggest that blue states California, New Jersey and New York would collectively have five fewer seats, while red states would see a net gain of three seats (+1 each in Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio and West Virginia and -1 in Texas). The other two seats lost by the blue states would go to swing states Michigan and Pennsylvania. This likely would've given the House GOP at least a couple of more seats overall, a big deal right now in the closely divided chamber. Plus, it would also have handed Trump five more electoral votes in 2024, increasing his victory in the Electoral College from a 312-216 win to a 317-211 advantage. *** Amid the flurry of actions Trump has taken in less than a week, we'll have to see what sticks legally and what resonates with or repels the public. Yet even if Trump's executive order regarding birthright citizenship is halted by the courts, there's little stopping him from trying again later in his presidency. He will certainly have opportunities to appoint more conservative judges to lower federal courts, and might even get another vacancy to fill on the Supreme Court. With a Republican-controlled Senate for at least two years — and quite possibly the rest of Trump's presidency — the new president will have ample opportunity to swing the judiciary further to the right and, potentially, find future agreement with his position on birthright citizenship. *Due to the technicalities in each nation's laws, different sources vary somewhat regarding which nations have birthright citizenship and their degree of restrictiveness. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",https://abcnews.go.com/538/make-trumps-attempt-end-birthright-citizenship/story?id=118023941,2025-04-09
TikTok is back online after Trump pledged to restore it | CNN BusinessClose icon,"Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Around 12 hours after shutting itself down in the United States, TikTok is back for many users almost like it never left, attributing its return to a move by President-elect Donald Trump to save the app. TikTok welcomed users back with a notification that said: “Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!” The whiplash move to bring the app back comes after TikTok became unusable for Americans late Saturday night. Users who tried to open the app at that time were met with a message saying it was offline and asking users to “stay tuned.” “A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can’t use TikTok for now,” TikTok’s message read in part. The app was also unavailable on the Apple and Google Play stores, along with Lemon8 and CapCut, which are also owned by TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance. Early on Sunday, Trump said he would issue an executive order following his inauguration on Monday to delay enforcement of the divest-or-ban law. And within hours, access to TikTok’s app and webpage began to return for US users. TikTok’s restoration will be welcome news for the app’s 170 million American users, many of whom use the app for hours every day to find news, entertainment and community and, in some cases, to make a living, after weeks of uncertainty. And it signaled that Trump may be poised to score a major political victory by claiming responsibility for bringing back the popular platform. In a statement midday Sunday, TikTok said Trump’s promise to save the app allowed it to restore US users’ access even before his expected executive order is signed. “In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,” the company said in a statement. “We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.” TikTok CEO Shou Chew is expected to attend Trump’s “Make America Great Again Victory Rally” in Washington, DC, Sunday night, before being seated prominently at the incoming president’s inauguration Monday. But while TikTok’s shutdown lasted just a few hours, securing the app’s long-term future in the United States is likely to be more complicated. Trump said Sunday in a Truth Social post that he plans to issue an executive order following his inauguration on Monday to “extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.” He urged TikTok’s partners to allow the app to be restored, saying “the order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order.” “Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,” Trump said. Trump had said he was considering a 90-day extension in the ban to give him time to work out a deal to sell the app to a non-Chinese owner. In his post, Trump said he would seek a 50-50 joint venture between TikTok’s existing parent company, China-based ByteDance, and a new, American owner. Such an announcement could serve as a kind of immediate political victory for Trump with America’s youth. Although Trump supported a TikTok ban in his first term as president, he has recently said he wants to keep the app alive — posting on Truth Social Sunday morning: “SAVE TIKTOK!” Last month, he asked the Supreme Court to stay the law so his incoming administration could work out a deal to keep TikTok available to Americans. The Supreme Court upheld the law on Friday. TikTok appealed to Trump in its pop-up message on the app starting late Saturday night notifying users that the app was unavailable in the United States. “We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office,” the company posted in its pop-up message. “Please stay tuned!” And Chew also lauded Trump in a video responding to the company’s Supreme Court loss on Friday, saying, “we are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform, one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process.” Trump attributed his election victory in part to TikTok at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago in December. “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” Trump said, then claiming to have won the youth vote by a significant margin. “And there are those that say that TikTok had something to do with it.” The law banning TikTok passed with strong bipartisan support in Congress, citing national security concerns. Although a Pew Research Center Survey in 2023 found about half of Americans supported the ban, it has consistently proven unpopular with younger generations. With his executive order, Trump is expected to delay enforcement of the ban to give TikTok parent company ByteDance more time to find an American owner. Trump’s Sunday message may have been enough to reassure TikTok’s technology partners, including Oracle, which hosts TikTok’s content in the United States, and Apple and Google, which host the app on their app stores, to continue supporting the app. Under the law, those companies could face penalties of up to $5,000 per person who has access to TikTok, if it is enforced. But the executive order could face challenges, including from members of Trump’s own party, who say they oppose any extension of the ban. “We commend Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft for following the law and halting operations with ByteDance and TikTok, and we encourage other companies to do the same,” Republican Senators Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, and Pete Ricketts, of Nebraska, wrote in a joint statement Sunday. “The law, after all, risks ruinous bankruptcy for any company who violates it. Now that the law has taken effect, there’s no legal basis for any kind of ‘extension’ of its effective date.” Cotton and Ricketts said TikTok should only come back online by “severing all ties between TikTok and Communist China. Only then will Americans be protected from the grave threat posed to their privacy and security by a communist-controlled TikTok.” The app’s brief blackout marked the realization of a yearslong effort to block US access to TikTok over national security concerns related to its China-based owner ByteDance. Outgoing President Joe Biden signed a law last April that gave ByteDance 270 days to sell TikTok to an owner from the United States or one of its allies or face a ban. So even if Trump pledges to reverse the ban, he can’t simply undo a law passed by Congress and signed by a president with an executive order. That’s why TikTok shut down in the first place. Despite the Biden administration all but saying they would defer enforcement to the incoming Trump administration, a person close to TikTok says “multiple critical service providers” indicated to TikTok that they were concerned that the ban might be enforced starting Sunday. For example, Apple released a statement Sunday that cited the ban as its reason for removing TikTok from its app store. It noted the app will remain available for customers who already downloaded it, but it won’t be able to be redownloaded if deleted. “Apple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates,” the company said in its statement. “Pursuant to the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, apps developed by ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiaries — including TikTok, CapCut, Lemon8, and others — will no longer be available for download or updates on the App Store for users in the United States starting January 19, 2025.” The only truly permanent solutions to keep TikTok online appear to be: 1) pass a new law reversing the old one — no easy task, considering that the existing bill had such broad bipartisan support in Congress — or 2) force a sale to an acceptable buyer. Two potential buyers — a group led by billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank’s” Kevin O’Leary, as well as AI search engine PerplexityAI — have submitted formal bids for the app and others have reportedly shown interest in TikTok. ByteDance, however, has long been adamant that it has no intention of selling. TikTok’s near-magical algorithm, keeping users hooked on the app, is its secret power, and putting a price tag on such a valuable commodity, envied by every other social media app, is difficult. McCourt’s buyer group has said it would buy TikTok’s US assets without the algorithm and rebuild the app, but tech giants like Meta and YouTube have for years worked to replicate TikTok’s popular algorithm without quite succeeding. O’Leary told CNN he met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month to discuss the outlook for the app. Spinning off an American-only version of TikTok could also mean the rest of the world has to download a new app to access US users’ content. Yet Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported last week that China is weighing a sale — to Elon Musk. Musk may have the resources to buy the app, and he’s a major Trump supporter and about to take a quasi-role in his government. But it’s unclear that he would want to, and he has not publicly commented directly on the acquisition reports. On Sunday, Musk posted on X that he opposes the TikTok ban “because it goes against freedom of speech.” “That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but X is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change,” Musk said. If ByteDance chooses to engage, Trump could perhaps argue that significant progress has been made on a deal — a legal threshold that would legally permit Trump to reverse the ban to allow the sale process to commence. In his Truth Social post Sunday, Trump said the United States should have “a 50% ownership position in a joint venture.” “By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say (sic) up,” he said. “Therefore, my initial thought is a joint venture between the current owners and/or new owners whereby the U.S. gets a 50% ownership in a joint venture set up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose.” That’s only a temporary measure, though, as the sale would ultimately need to go through. Until then, TikTok’s future will remain very much in doubt. When asked about the app’s restoration and Trump’s desire for a deal, China’s foreign ministry told reporters Monday that it believed companies should decide independently about their operations and deals. “We hope the US can listen to rational voices and provide an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory business environment for market players from all countries,” said ministry spokesperson Mao Ning. Many TikTok users had held onto hope that the shutdown would be short-lived. Still, the Saturday night shutdown was a sad loss for some users — a reminder of the app’s cultural influence. Many users joined the app in early 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic was otherwise isolating them from community and other creative outlets. “I’m so sad for so many people. I was shocked. I think I was probably in denial a little bit that it would actually just go dark,” influencer Shannon Lange told CNN early Sunday, before access to the app was restored. Influencer Alix Earle, who had nearly 8 million TikTok followers, posted a tearful video on the platform ahead of the shutdown saying, “I feel like I’m going through heartbreak. This platform is more than an app or a job to me. I have so many memories on here. I have posted every day for the past 6 years of my life.” Julie Turkel, a TikTok creator who said she was scrolling the app when it stopped working Saturday night, called the shutdown “surreal.” “It was just surreal, it did have a very eerie feeling,” Turkel told CNN. She added that although she had anticipated the shutdown after TikTok’s warnings last week, “seeing it actually go down is different.” Turkel told CNN early Sunday she was taking a digital “detox,” opting not to spend time on Instagram or other short-form video platforms, while TikTok was down. The break didn’t last long. When the app returned on Sunday, Lange posted a video smiling and dancing, with overlaid text that read: “Longest 13 hours of my life and I was sleeping for 9 of them.” – CNN’s Brian Stelter and Marc Stewart contributed to this report.

New Snowflake Data Breach Exposes Millions of Customers,"Snowflake data breach exposes 2M Advance Auto Parts customers. Sensitive info compromised due to lack of MFA. New security measures and MFA adoption urged. Allison Francis Channel Insider content and product recommendations are editorially independent. We may make money when you click on links to our partners. View our editorial policy here. More information has come to light about another significant data breach targeting Snowflake customers. The cloud computing-based data company has come under scrutiny recently due to multiple attacks targeting its customers, citing the lack of proper security practices. This time around, Advance Auto Parts has revealed that over 2 million customers’ data might have been compromised. According to a filing with the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, Advance Auto Parts discovered on May 23 that an unauthorized third party had accessed some of the data stored in Snowflake, their cloud storage and data warehousing provider. “We began an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident with the support of third-party experts, and took measures to contain the incident and terminate the unauthorized access,” the filing said. “Our investigation determined that an unauthorized third party accessed or copied certain information maintained by Advance Auto Parts (from April 14 to May 24). We conducted a detailed review and analysis of the affected information to determine the types of information contained therein and to whom the information relates. This review was completed on June 10, 2024.” This news comes on the heels of reports about other data breaches involving Snowflake clients, including major players like Ticketmaster, Santander Bank, and Neiman Marcus Group, which have heightened the risk of exposure for affected customers. The wave of data theft attacks is believed to involve the use of stolen passwords. In a breach notice posted Wednesday by the Maine attorney general’s office, Advance Auto Parts revealed that over 2.3 million individuals were impacted by an April attack on its Snowflake deployment. The stolen customer data may include names, Social Security numbers, and driver’s license numbers, according to the company. “Upon learning of the incident, we promptly terminated the unauthorized access and took proactive measures aimed at preventing future unauthorized access,” the company said. “We also notified law enforcement. In addition, we continue to work with third-party cybersecurity experts to take steps to further harden our systems and emerge from this incident an even more secure organization.” According to Mandiant researchers, a cybercriminal group is “suspected of stealing a large volume of records from Snowflake customer environments.” They confirmed that the affected accounts did not have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled. In a blog post on Tuesday, Snowflake announced that administrators can now require MFA for users and monitor compliance. “To help drive MFA adoption, we’re taking steps to promote individual compliance for Snowflake users,” the company stated in the post. Indeed, MFA is generally considered the gold standard for cybersecurity. Experts strongly recommended implementing it to protect users from threats, stressing that not doing so can leave a gaping hole in defenses, one that attackers can easily squeeze through and exploit. “The absence of basic cyber hygiene by any provider can result in catastrophic consequences throughout a supply chain that affect the bottom line of countless customers,” said Dawn Sizer, CEO of 3rd Element Consulting. “The lack of accountability and consequences has to stop – it has become the norm with no end in sight. U.S. businesses (all of them, really) must be held responsible and liable for damages they do to other businesses when they fail to adhere to the bare minimum of security standards, or neglect to do due diligence on their products.” Read more about how the recent Snowflake breaches have underscored the critical importance of robust and proactive security measures such as MFA.

The Post's 10 best moments of the 2024 Paris Olympics,"The Paris Games came to a close on Sunday with the Americans atop the medal count. The two weeks in the French capital marked the first Summer Games unaffected by COVID since Rio 2016, and one of the most successful Olympics ever for Team USA, which tied China with 40 gold medals and 126 medals overall. There was no shortage of memorable moments, but here are 10 that stuck in our mind. Going into Paris, the last American male to win the 100-meter dash and hold the title of ‘Fastest Man in the World’ was Justin Gatlin in 2004. Lyles, after struggling in the 2020 Tokyo Games, crossed the line just five-thousandths of a second ahead of Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson to stand atop the podium — a finish so close that Lyles didn’t realize he won until seconds after the fact. Although he failed to complete the double, settling for a bronze medal in the 200 meters, his 9.784 in the 100 stands as one of the iconic moments of the Games. For Katie Ledecky, this Olympics was the Drive for Nine as she hoped to take GOAT status in women’s swimming. That’s just what she did, with a pair of golds in the 800 and 1500-meter freestyle races to go with silver in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay and bronze in the 400-meter freestyle race. Ledecky’s nine gold medals and 14 overall medals made her the most-decorated American woman and most-decorated female swimmer in history, while tying with former gymnast Larisa Latynina for the most gold medals of any woman in Olympic history. Simone Biles was widely considered the best gymnast ever going into these Olympics, but there was unfinished business at play after her Tokyo Games were derailed by a case of the “twisties.” A trio of gold medals in the team all-around, individual all-around and vault, along with a silver in the floor exercise, set things right. If this was the last go-round for Biles at the Olympic Games — she’ll be 31 in 2028 — it was a perfect way to close things out. The men’s 1500-meter race was billed as a continuation of the rivalry between Great Britain’s Josh Kerr and Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen. But Cole Hocker, an Indianapolis native running in his first Olympics, crashed the party. As the two favorites vied for gold throughout the race, Hocker used an out-of-nowhere kick in the final 100 meters to pass them both, setting an Olympic record at 3:27.65, with Yared Nuguse — another American — nipping Ingebrigtsen for bronze. This marked the closest men’s basketball competition at the Olympics in a long time, with the Americans being pushed to the limit in a semifinal comeback victory against Serbia and in their gold medal victory against France. As good as the Serbia game was, though, the lasting image of these Games will be Stephen Curry’s three straight 3-pointers in the final minutes of the game against France, including a heave over two defenders that was immediately termed a “golden dagger” by NBC’s Noah Eagle. It was Curry’s first ever Olympics, and it’s hard to imagine Team USA could have survived without him. Just like on the men’s side, the women’s basketball team needed everything it had to get past France in the gold medal round. It took a pair of free throws with just under four seconds to go — and a fair bit of luck with Gabby Williams putting her foot on the 3-point line as she heaved what would have been a game-tying shot — for the Americans to escape with a 61st-straight Olympic victory and their eighth straight gold, dating back to 1996. The challenge made it all the more sweet. The pressure was on the women’s soccer program after a disastrous 2023 World Cup knocked it off the sport’s highest perch and plunged it into uncertainty. But in Emma Hayes’ first tournament as head coach, the former Chelsea manager brought the joy back to a team that had turned the page on last summer, finding its taliswomen in Sophia Smith and Trinity Rodman while riding some fantastic goalkeeping from Alyssa Naeher to a gold medal victory over Brazil. The men’s and women’s 4×400-meter relays were run back-to-back on the last night of track and field, and it was the Americans who took home a memorable pair of golds. First, on the men’s side, Westchester native Rai Benjamin crossed the line a mere tenth of a second ahead of Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo on the anchor leg to take gold. The women would have no such drama, as New Jersey native Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone’s astonishing second leg led the United States in blowing away the field and winning by over four seconds, coming 0.1 seconds short of the world record, set by the 1988 Russian team that was beset by doping. For a local angle to these Games, you couldn’t do any better than Marchand, who became an overnight sensation in Paris during the leadup to the Olympics. The 22-year-old more than lived up to the hype once he got in the pool, taking four gold medals, including the 200-meter butterfly and 200-meter breaststroke on the same night. He chased down Hungarian Kristof Milak in the last 50 meters of the butterfly to set an Olympic record. Naturally, the atmosphere for each of Marchand’s swims was electric, with the French crowd even timing its chants with Marchand coming up for air. There was one peak left for Novak Djokovic to climb in tennis history and he did so in Paris. The Serb became just the fifth player ever to complete the Golden Slam, winning all four majors and an Olympics, when he beat Carlos Alcaraz in the final at Roland Garros. The 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) victory was an instant classic, with the two best players on the planet leaving everything on the court and Djokovic coming out ahead in a pair of tiebreaks.
